Awesome! Let’s get started with a structured plan. We’ll begin with a **Requirements Document** and then follow with a **Step-by-Step Build Guide** for the **AI-Powered Smart Study Assistant** project.

## 📄 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

### 🧠 Project Title:

**AI-Powered Smart Study Assistant**

---

### 📝 Overview:

A web application that helps students study smarter by allowing them to upload notes (PDF/text), summarize content, generate quizzes, and ask questions — all powered by AI. Includes a user dashboard and history tracking.

---

### 🎯 Objectives:

* Help users interact with their study material via AI
* Provide summaries, Q\&A, and quiz generation
* Allow students to track their learning history

---

### 🧱 System Architecture:

#### Components:

* **Frontend**: React or Next.js (UI/UX, input forms, results display)
* **Backend**: FastAPI (REST API to handle requests and user data)
* **AI Engine**: Python (Hugging Face models or OpenAI API)
* **Database**: MongoDB (store users, history, uploads)
* **Storage**: Cloud storage (S3 or local dev)
* **Authentication**: JWT-based login system

---

### 🔐 Key Features:

| Feature               | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| User Authentication   | Signup, login, session tokens              |
| Upload Study Material | Upload PDF or paste text                   |
| Summarization         | AI-generated summary of uploaded material  |
| Quiz Generation       | AI-generated multiple-choice questions     |
| Q\&A Chat Interface   | Ask AI questions based on uploaded content |
| Study Dashboard       | View history, past quizzes, and summaries  |

---

### 🧪 Functional Requirements:

* PDF parsing
* Text summarization (e.g., `T5`, `GPT`, or `BART`)
* Question generation (e.g., `T5`, GPT-based QA)
* Context-aware Q\&A (e.g., LangChain + vector store)
* Responsive frontend UI
* Secure backend with protected routes

---

### 🛠️ Non-Functional Requirements:

* Cross-device compatibility
* 99% uptime for APIs (after deployment)
* Basic error handling and retries
* Responsive UI/UX

---

## 🛠️ BUILD GUIDE

---

### 🔧 1. **Project Setup**

#### ✅ Frontend:

* Initialize with **Next.js** or **React + Vite**

```bash
npx create-next-app ai-study-assistant
```

* Install Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

#### ✅ Backend:

* Create Python environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install FastAPI + Uvicorn + dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart pymongo pydantic
```

#### ✅ AI Module:

* Use Hugging Face Transformers:

```bash
pip install transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu
```

* Or: use OpenAI API

```bash
pip install openai
```

---

### 🧱 2. **Basic Architecture**

```
/client          --> React/Next.js frontend
/server          --> FastAPI backend
/server/ai       --> AI pipeline (summarizer, quiz generator, etc.)
/server/routes   --> FastAPI route definitions
/server/models   --> Pydantic schemas
```

---

### 🧠 3. **AI Model Integration**

* **Summarizer**: `T5`, `BART`, or `OpenAI` GPT
* **Quiz Generator**: Use `T5` or prompt GPT-3.5
* **Q\&A Bot**:

  * Vectorize uploaded notes (use `FAISS`)
  * Use `sentence-transformers` for embeddings
  * Query using cosine similarity
  * Use `LangChain` for better chaining if needed

---

### 🖼️ 4. **Frontend Components**

* `UploadComponent`: For PDFs and text input
* `ChatComponent`: For Q\&A
* `SummaryComponent`: Show summarized notes
* `QuizComponent`: Show MCQs
* `Dashboard`: Track past interactions

---

### 🧪 5. **Backend API Endpoints (FastAPI)**

```http
POST /auth/signup        → Register
POST /auth/login         → Login
POST /upload/pdf         → Upload and parse PDF
POST /ai/summarize       → Generate summary
POST /ai/quiz            → Generate quiz
POST /ai/ask             → Ask questions (contextual)
GET  /dashboard/history  → Get previous queries/results
```

---

### 🗃️ 6. **Database Schema (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)**

```json
User {
  id,
  email,
  passwordHash,
  createdAt
}

StudyMaterial {
  id,
  userId,
  title,
  rawText,
  summary,
  createdAt
}

Quiz {
  id,
  materialId,
  questions: [ { question, options, correctAnswer } ],
  createdAt
}
```

---

### 🚀 7. **Deployment**

* **Frontend**: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify
* **Backend**: Use Railway or Render
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas or Supabase

---

### 📌 8. **Stretch Goals**

* Speech-to-text for audio notes
* ChatGPT-style assistant with context memory
* User feedback loop to improve quiz accuracy
* Mobile version with React Native

---

Would you like me to generate:

* A GitHub repository boilerplate?
* The architecture diagram?
* A user flow mockup?

Let me know where you want to start coding first (frontend/backend/AI), and I’ll walk you through it.
